#richfetch

A richly customisable fetch utility which provides a ton lot of information. Written in Python.

## Sample:

## Capabilities:
`richfetch` displays the following info (in order):

- user@hostname
- cpu usage %age
- cpu temp
- WM name
- uptime
- ram used/total ram (ram usage %age)
- disk used/total disk (disk usage %age)
- local ip
- public ip *do not forget to hide this when posting screenshots etc*

`richfetch` uses nerdfonts to display the symbols. What I use is JetBrains Mono Nerd Font so I know it works. You can try different nerd fonts to see if your works.
